The key idea is to create artworks starting from a biological level and moving up. Starting with looking at a DNA sequence and moving up to how your cells look under a microscope to then the close-up image of your hand and then moving out and out. Using all of these images that I then collect, I will then fine tune a model and let it decide what the final piece will look like. I will do this process everywhere so the final image will be that of a human.
